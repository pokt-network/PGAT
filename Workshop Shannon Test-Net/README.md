This folder contains a [series of guides](./docs/README.md) used in the Shannon Test-Net Workshop and example code to send a relay using the [Shanon GO SDK](https://github.com/pokt-network/shannon-sdk/).

This is intended to be a basic course so you can understand the most important mechanisms in the POKT Network and how to interact with it.

Most of the code presented here was extracted from the [PATH gateway implementation](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/), which is an industry-grade implementation of a POKT Network gateway.

Tested on commits:
- Docker compose example: `8a4423b`
- Shannon SDK: `2b3d4ad`
- POKT Network client:  `v0.0.11`
- Test-Net height: `62539`

# LLM Backend

This is a sample of how the LLM backend (the one pointed by the Relay Miner) should work on the POKT Network.
The important thing is that it has an [OpenAI compatible API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and that the model name is `pocket_network`.

You don't need to deploy this if you are going to test with another kind of backend, like an ETH node.

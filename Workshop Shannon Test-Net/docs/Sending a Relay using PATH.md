# Sending a Relay using PATH

**REQUIREMENTS**: A running full node. See [Full Node Setup](./Full%20Node%20Setup.md)
**REQUIREMENTS**: A Servicer. See [Supplier and Relay Miner](./Supplier%20and%20Relay%20Miner.md)
**REQUIREMENTS**: A staked Application and Gateway. See [Applications and Gateways](./Applications%20and%20Gateways.md)

### PATH

This is the easiest way to send a relay through the POKT network. 

Now, to set this up you will need to set some environment variables first, in the `.env` file:

```
APPLICATION_PRIV_KEY_HEX="<THE PRIVATE HEX OF THE APPLICATION ACCOUNT>"
APPLICATION_ADDR="<APPLICATION ACCOUNT ADDRESS>"

GATEWAY_PRIV_KEY_HEX="<THE PRIVATE HEX OF THE GATEWAY ACCOUNT>"
GATEWAY_ADDR="<GATEWAY ACCOUNT ADDRESS>"
```

In order to obtain the private key hex, execute the following:
`yes | docker exec -i full-node poktrolld keys export beta-gateway-rawthil --unsafe --unarmored-hex | tail -n1 | tr -d '\r'`
replace `beta-gateway-rawthil` with the names you gave to the application and gateway keys.


Edit the gateway config file at `gateway/config/gateway_config.yaml` and set:
- `gateway_address` with your gateway account address.
- `gateway_private_key_hex` with your gateway account private key hex.

Now, there are two ways for running the gateway:
- **Centralized Mode**: The gateway will use its own app, to do this, add the `application` hex in the `owned_apps_private_keys_hex`.
- **Delegated Mode**: The gateway will use the requester app, provided it had delegated to the gateway, to do this change the `gateway_mode` to `delegated` and remove the entries for `owned_apps_private_keys_hex`.

Finally, start the PATH gateway server:
`docker compose up -d gateway`

To test with a relay we can do, in "Centralized Mode":
```bash
curl http://ai.localhost:3069/v1/v1/completions \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "target-service-id: A100" \
  --data '{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Write a short joke about Pokemon\n\n### Response:","max_tokens":256, "model":"pocket_network"}'
```

And for "Delegated Mode" you will need to add your delegated app address as a header:
```bash
curl http://ai.localhost:3069/v1/v1/completions \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-App-Address: pokt1jc3ttp3w5lku9cxh2k23w0f9uskvekgsdsqchr" \
  -H "target-service-id: A100" \
  --data '{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Write a short joke about Pokemon\n\n### Response:","max_tokens":256, "model":"pocket_network"}'
```

Its important to note that the target backend path (`v1/completions`) is written after the `v1` thats from PATH's API.
